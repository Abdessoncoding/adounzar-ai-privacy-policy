  <h2>5. Purposes for processing & legal bases</h2>
  <p>We process personal data to provide, operate, and maintain the Service; connect and maintain integrations with Meta products; improve, analyze, and personalize the Service; respond to support requests; process payments and prevent fraud; and comply with legal requests. Where required by law we rely on your consent for certain activities (e.g., marketing).</p>

We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>7. Data storage & international transfers</h2>
  <p>We store data on secure servers. Data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your jurisdiction (including the U.S.); we implement safeguards such as standard contractual clauses where required.</p>

  <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
